        <h2>Policy Uncertainty, Misinformation, and Retirement Age Reform</h2>
        <p class="authors">with Maximilian Blesch</p>

          Abstract</button><span id="abstract_polunc" class="abstract">: This study examines the impact of Statutory Retirement Age (SRA) reforms on individual behavior and welfare in the presence of policy uncertainty and misinformation. We develop a structural life-cycle model in which individuals are uncertain about the future evolution of the SRA and misinformed about its importance. We derive individuals' expectations and information on the SRA from self-elicited belief data using the German Socio-Economic Panel Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS). The model accounts for key life-cycle savings and old-age labor supply determinants, such as human capital accumulation, involuntary job loss, health status, and family dynamics. We estimate the model using decision data from the core sample of the SOEP. We design counterfactual simulations to assess the effects of SRA reforms and illustrate the trade-offs of several implementation strategies.</span>

        <h2>Public Appeals and Collective Crisis Mitigation</h2>
        <p class="authors">with Peter Haan, Lea Heursen, Jule Specht, Georg Weizsäcker</p>
        <button class="abstract-toggle" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract_appeals')">
          Abstract</button><span id="abstract_appeals" class="abstract">: Arrivals of crises often trigger public appeals from policy leaders, attempting to encourage crisis-mitigating behaviors. We ask whether the tone of an appeal changes its effectiveness, and to what extent policymakers know what tone to use. Using a controlled experiment in a large, general-population sample, we first study the impact of appeals and of their emotional tone on contributions to a well-defined crisis mitigation effort. Two equivalent appeals have either positive-tone or negative-tone wordings, and both increase contributions by about 20% compared to no appeal. Next, a sample of policymakers (n=88) is presented with our design and asked to predict the outcome. Although they correctly predict the impact of the positive appeal, they substantially underestimate the effectiveness of the negative one.</span>

        <h2>Underestimated Adaptability</h2>
          <button class="abstract-toggle" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract_adaptability')">
          Abstract</button><span id="abstract_adaptability" class="abstract">: Recent theories predict attenuated responses to price changes in the standard consumer choice problem. Several different cognitive limitation leads to both own-price elasticities and cross-price elasticities that are too close to zero. I give an overview over existing theories and test them as well as two important conjectures with an online experiment: i. more deliberation time should decrease attenuation, ii. beliefs about own future choice should be more attenuated than the choice itself. The experiment features induced, quasilinear preferences and a reference point in the form of the optimum at an 'old' set of prices. After a price change, participant under time pressure predict their own choice and then choose a new consumption bundle. Results confirm the hypotheses. Participants start evaluating their choice close to the old optimum and then gradually move toward the new one. Their prediction of their own choices are closer to the old optimum than their actual choices are. These findings suggest consumers systematically underestimate their ability to adapt to economic changes, with implications for commitment decisions and political economy of price-based policies.</span>
