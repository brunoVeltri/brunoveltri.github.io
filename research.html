    <h2>Policy Uncertainty, Misinformation, and Retirement Age Reform</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: gray;">
      with Maximilian Blesch
    </p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study examines the impact of Statutory Retirement Age (SRA) reforms on
      individual behavior and welfare in the presence of policy uncertainty and misinfor-
      mation. We develop a structural life-cycle model in which individuals are uncertain
      about the future evolution of the SRA and misinformed about its importance. We
      derive individuals’ expectations and information on the SRA from self-elicited belief
      data using the German Socio-Economic Panel Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS). The
      model accounts for key life-cycle savings and old-age labor supply determinants,
      such as human capital accumulation, involuntary job loss, health status, and family
      dynamics. We estimate the model using decision data from the core sample of the
      SOEP. We design counterfactual simulations to assess the effects of SRA reforms
      and illustrate the trade-offs of several implementation strategies.</p>
    <h2>Public Appeals and Collective Crisis Mitigation</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: gray;">
      with Peter Haan, Lea Heursen, Jule Specht, Georg Weizs¨acker
    </p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Arrivals of crises often trigger public appeals from policy leaders, attempting to en-
      courage crisis-mitigating behaviors. We ask whether the tone of an appeal changes
      its effectiveness, and to what extent policymakers know what tone to use. Using a
      controlled experiment in a large, general-population sample, we first study the im-
      pact of appeals and of their emotional tone on contributions to a well-defined crisis
      mitigation effort. Two equivalent appeals have either positive-tone or negative-tone
      wordings, and both increase contributions by about 20% compared to no appeal.
      Next, a sample of policymakers (n=88) is presented with our design and asked to
      predict the outcome. Although they correctly predict the impact of the positive
      appeal, they substantially underestimate the effectiveness of the negative one.</p>
